            sandwich\",\"alsoKnownAs\":[]},\"placeOfOrigin\":\"In the 1993 film Benny and Joon, the illiterate, beguiling Sam, played by a young Johnny Depp, cooks a stack of grilled cheese sandwiches using a clothes iron. An appalling culinary technique, yes, but arguably a big moment for this down-home sandwich: anything Johnny Depp touches, after all, has to be important.\n\nAnd important it is: some three-quarters of people who buy sliced cheese make at least one grilled cheese a month. While similar recipes are mentioned in Ancient Roman texts\u2014and, let\u2019s face it, the French have been making their famous croque monsieurs since the early 1900s\u2014today\u2019s notion of the grilled cheese is commonly traced back to the 1920s, when the Iowa man considered \u201Cthe father of sliced bread\u201D invented a bread slicer that made distributing white bread easy and affordable. Shortly before that, processed cheese had been patented by James L. Kraft\u2014you\u2019ll recognize that name, of course\u2014an entrepreneur whose revolutionary pasteurizing process ensured that cheese wouldn\u2019t spoil, even when transported long distances. By 1914, J.L. Kraft and Bros. Company (the precursor to Kraft Foods) opened its first plant in Illinois; five years later, the company had already expanded into Canada. Of course, this \u201Cfactory cheese\u201D\u2014disparagingly termed \u201Crattrap cheese\u201D or \u201Crat cheese\u201D by the English, who were fiercely proud of their cheddars\u2014was not considered a delicacy. It was, simply, a cheap, nutritious, and scalable product.\n\nFrom there on out, both sliced bread and processed cheese went full steam ahead. During World War II, Navy cooks prepared countless \u201CAmerican cheese filling sandwiches\u201D\u2014as instructed by government-issued cookbooks\u2014in ships\u2019 kitchens. In the 1940s and \u201850s, these were usually served open-faced and consisted of one slice of bread topped with grated cheese. In 1949, Kraft Foods introduced Kraft Singles\u2014individually wrapped slices of processed cheese\u2014and supermarkets began stocking them in 1965. Also around that time, the second, perhaps most important, piece of bread was added on top, likely as a way to make the sandwich more filling, and the modern notion of a grilled cheese sandwich was born.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the actual term \u201Cgrilled cheese\u201D doesn\u2019t make an appearance in print until the 1960s; it was all \u201Ctoasted cheese\u201D or \u201Cmelted cheese\u201D sandwiches before then. Which speaks to a larger point: how you actually cook this sandwich doesn\u2019t really matter, and historically the methods have been all over the map. As early as 1902, a recipe for a \u201CMelted Cheese,\u201D designed to be cooked in a hot oven, appeared in Sarah Tyson Rorer\u2019s Mrs. Rorer\u2019s New Cook Book; a recipe published in 1929 in Florence A. Cowles\u2019 Seven Hundred Sandwiches called to broil the ingredients to make \u201CToasted Cheese.\u201D \u201CToasted Sandwich,\u201D published in 1939 in The Boston Cooking School Cook Book, encouraged the ingredients to be broiled or even\u2014gasp!\u2014sauteed in a frying pan coated with butter. And in The Joy of Cooking (1953), Irma S. Rombauer wrote that bread and cheese should be heated in a commercial waffle iron\u2014an easy meal for even \u201Cthe maidless host\u201D to prepare.\n\nFast forward (past Johnny Depp\u2019s creative cooking methods on-screen) to present day. Strange things have happened with the grilled cheese sandwich. In 2004, the online casino GoldenPalace.com paid $28,000 for a half-eaten grilled cheese with the likeness of the Virgin Mary depicted in the \u201Cburn\u201D pattern. The sandwich had been sold to the casino by a Florida woman who had kept the sandwich intact for a decade\u2014no joke\u2014before trying her (ultimately successful) luck on eBay. Two years later, American competitive eater Joey Chestnut won the World Green Chile Grilled Cheese Eating Champion by devouring a whopping 34.5 grilled cheeses in one sitting.\n\nIn 2007, Kraft Foods budgeted a record $1.4 billion to its marketing efforts, a large portion of which was slated to \u201Cget grilled cheese back onto the list of quick menu options\u201D and revitalize Kraft Singles. A contest held on the now-obsolete social network MySpace asked users to create and upload home videos celebrating grilled cheese for a chance to win $50,000. The goal? \u201CGet people to make just one more grilled cheese sandwich a year,\u201D said the Kraft global executive creative director at the time. Kraft continued its tear the following year by asking fans to write about their favorite grilled cheese memory for a chance to win a free pack of Kraft Singles. And in 2009, Los Angeles hosted the world\u2019s first grilled cheese cooking competition: thousands and thousands of people competed at and attended the National Grilled Cheese Invitational, which has turned into a much-anticipated annual food festival.\",\"description\":\"A ham and cheese
